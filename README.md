# Landing Page

Landing page based on desktop-only design. Here's the technology stack I used for this project.

## Technology stack

I utilized webpack to bundle HTML templates, LESS styling sheets and JavaScript code.

## Test environment

- Google Chrome 90.0.4430.93
- Firefox 88.0.1
- Microsoft Edge 90.0.818.51

## Challenges

I completed this project quicker than the previous one. It was challenging enough to keep me awake at 4AM in the morning (happened twice) and give me thrills in the process. There were few things that took awhile to figure out.

## Attributions

1. [HTMLAcademy's](https://htmlacademy.ru/) Pawel Betkowski made the original design layout in `.psd`. I got it through now discontinued free subscription campaign and included a raster version of the design in this repo as `wheels.png`.
